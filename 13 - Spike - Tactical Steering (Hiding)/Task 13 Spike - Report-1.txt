SPIKE REPORT #13: Tactical Steering & Hiding Behavior
Submitted by: mai tien dat tran (104207944)
OVERVIEW
This spike focused on implementing a predator-prey simulation with tactical hiding. Key goals included:

Prey agents that seek concealment behind environmental objects to evade hunter agents
Distinct visual representations and capabilities for hunter vs prey agents
Visual indicators of potential hiding spots for prey to choose from
Prey agents that intelligently select optimal hiding locations based on tactical analysis
Hiding that occurs behind objects, not inside them

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Languages, Tools & Resources:

Python 3.12.0
AI assistance from ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) and Claude (https://claude.ai/chats)
Adapted code from Lab 11 (Steering Behaviors) and Lab 12 (Wander & Paths)

Implementation Approach:

Reused Vector2D, Matrix33 and Point2D classes from prior labs without changes
Minor UI tweaks to graphics.py to show agent properties like mass, speed, status
Retained core game loop/state management in game.py
Refactored world.py to manage prey and hunter agents instead of generic agent list
Significant changes to agent.py:

Agent class converted to abstract base with core steering methods
Added Prey subclass with Idle and Hiding states, obstacle avoidance, threat-based hiding spot selection
Added Hunter subclass with Wander and Chase states


Created new Obstacle class representing concealable objects

Circular shape with color-coded safety level (based on hunter proximity)
Light green = safe, dark green = unsafe, orange = optimal





Successfully demonstrated prey agents quickly identifying and moving to optimal hiding spots when hunters approach
Smoothly integrated basic seeking and evasion AI routines from Lab 12

LIMITATIONS & RISKS

Obstacle avoidance not always effective - high agent acceleration can lead to clipping
Crashes observed with large numbers of prey agents

Opportunity for optimization in picking hiding spots and chase targets



NEXT STEPS
To enhance realism and challenge, explore more advanced features such as:

Coordinated pack-hunting and herding behaviors
Allowing prey to leverage memory of past successful hiding spots
Dynamic environmental hazards and concealment options
